<p>Hi there, I'm Xenia. I'm a starting web developer from Prague.</p>

<p>I started my IT training at the Discovery Piscine program at 42 Prague. I got to know many people who are willing to take their career path to IT field. Mostly women, who are determined and tenacious.</p>

<p>Right now I'm taking the course "Become a Full-Stack Web Developer with just ONE course. HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, React, PostgreSQL, Web3 and DApps" with Angela Yu. I'm creating this website as a part of the portfolio at this course.</p>
